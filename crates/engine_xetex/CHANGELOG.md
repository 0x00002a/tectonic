# tectonic_engine_xetex 0.1.0 (2021-06-03)

This crate introduces the XeTeX engine as a standalone crate, building on the
new "core bridge" functionality.

Compared to the implementation previously provided in the main `tectonic` crate,
it also adds shell-escape functionality and iterates the Rust API somewhat.
