# tectonic_status_base 0.1.0 (2021-01-15)

Initial release: a new crate with basic Tectonic status-reporting traits.

A lot of this is admittedly close to generic logging infrastructure, but we do
have some custom methods to help support a nice polished Tectonic UX. And that
will likely continue to be the case going forward.
